Love the hit TV show [*Black Mirror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror), but wonder what it would be like in real life? Never fear... awesome-black-mirror to the rescue!

(Yes this is satire, but the links are real.)

## Season 1
- ["The National Anthem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Anthem_(Black_Mirror)): Livestreaming is [real](https://www.twitch.tv/).
- ["Fifteen Million Merits"](): [Exercise bikes that show you Netflix](https://www.self.com/story/cycflix-exercise-bike) if you keep pedaling. Also, a world full of [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification).

## Season 3
- ["Shut Up and Dance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_Up_and_Dance_(Black_Mirror)): [Just use this](https://www.amazon.com/slp/laptop-camera-cover/uf85n8xg4r9q878).
