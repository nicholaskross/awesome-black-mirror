# Awesome Black Mirror [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Love the hit TV show [*Black Mirror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror), but wonder what it would be like in real life?

## Season 1
- ["The National Anthem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Anthem_(Black_Mirror)): Livestreaming is [real](https://www.twitch.tv/).
- ["Fifteen Million Merits"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Million_Merits): [Exercise bikes that show you Netflix](https://www.self.com/story/cycflix-exercise-bike) if you keep pedaling. Also, a world full of [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) and [energy harvesting](https://www.inverse.com/article/11045-this-stamp-sized-pair-of-electrodes-turns-humans-into-batteries).
- ["The Entire Hustory of You"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entire_History_of_You): [Every](https://www.google.com/glass/start/) [eyewear](https://www.spectacles.com/) [recording](https://www.amazon.com/Sunglasses-Recording-Shooting-Glasses-Cycling/dp/B07Q4J16Y3) [device](https://developer.sony.com/develop/smarteyeglass-sed-e1/). Also, a [Samsung thing](https://www.inverse.com/article/13950-samsung-invents-black-mirror-contact-lenses-that-live-stream-your-life) that doesn't appear to have gone anywhere.

## Season 2
- ["Be Right Back"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back): Anyone can build a [text messaging chatbot](https://www.ventureharbour.com/best-chatbot-builders/), and [advanced](https://blog.s-m.ac/GPT-2-ChatBot/) [ones](https://replika.ai/) [aren't](https://www.cleverbot.com/) [unheard](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/) [of](https://aidungeon.io/). The first human [may or may not have been cloned](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/chinese-scientist-claims-hes-created-worlds-first-gene-edited-babies).

## Season 3
- ["Shut Up and Dance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_Up_and_Dance_(Black_Mirror)): [Shut up and use this](https://www.amazon.com/slp/laptop-camera-cover/uf85n8xg4r9q878), saves the hassle.
